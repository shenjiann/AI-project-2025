Moving forward, we will explore the basic concepts, structure and applications of **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.Convolutional neural networks, a type of neural network designed to process data with a grid-like structure, are one of the most important models in the field of deep learning.In this homework, we will introduce the **convolution operation**, the core component of a convolutional neural network. Hope you enjoy the third homework!   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Goal**: In this homework,We will start with one-dimensional convolution, introducing important concepts such as **Convolution, Padding, and Stride**, and then introduce two-dimensional convolution and multichannel convolution. After this homework, you will achieve the following:\n",
    " * Understand important concepts such as Convolution, Padding, and Stride.\n",
    " * Learn the significance of 1D convolution, 2D convolution and multi-channel convolution and be able to implement them in code.\n",
